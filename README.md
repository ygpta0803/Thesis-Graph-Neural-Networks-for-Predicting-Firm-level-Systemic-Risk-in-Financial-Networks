Contagion Modelling: Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Firm-level Systemic Risk in Financial Networks

Abstract Systemic risk in financial markets, the potential for contagion from individual institutions to the broader system, threatens economic stability, as seen in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, 2020 COVID-19 turmoil, and 2023 banking collapses. Accurate prediction of this risk is crucial for regulators and investors to pre-emptively mitigate shocks, yet traditional methods like vector autoregressions (VAR) with forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) for spillover indices and multivariate GARCH models often fail to capture non-linear dynamics, complex inter-node relationships beyond simple correlations, and the role of network topology in individual vulnerabilities. This project develops predictive models for node-level volatility spillovers, defined as the from-others share of each firm’s forecast error variance in returns attributable to shocks from other institutions. Weekly panel data from 2019–2025 for 24 major banking firms are used to construct dynamic correlation networks, with nodes as institutions, edges as interconnections, and enriched features including market indicators, FinBERT sentiment scores, macro controls (e.g., VIX), and network centralities. Models are trained on rolling windows of up to 52 weeks to forecast next week’s spillover exposure, thereby providing early warnings of institutions most vulnerable to systemic contagion - critical for preempting chain reactions that could escalate isolated shocks into widespread financial instability, as demonstrated in recent crises. Preliminary results demonstrate that the best-tuned GNN (with a test RMSE of 0.1155) outperforms the VAR baseline (RMSE: 0.2757) by 58.11%, the GARCH baseline (RMSE: 0.1738) by 33.55%, and the MLP baseline (RMSE: 0.1548) by 25.40%, leveraging non-linear network interactions and a diverse set of features. Contributions include insights into contagion dynamics in financial networks, though limitations (e.g., correlational edges) suggest future causal graph extensions. This work bridges financial economics and machine learning, enhancing macroprudential policy
